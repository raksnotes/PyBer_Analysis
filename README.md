### When comparing the variables ride_id, driver_count, fare by city type, there is a
### commonality which is that the Urban cities have the highest rides, drivers and fares
### among the three city types.

# Summary 

One thing I would recommend is that people who live in rural areas have very little access to resources for healthy long-term living which would include health care and also it is more probable that people who live in rural areas live with little to no income, so I think that lowering fares for rural areas would be helpful.
